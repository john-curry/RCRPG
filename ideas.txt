==========================================
Ideas for what is now called race car game
  (maybe cause all it has is a race car)
==========================================

// IMPORTANT should i do this in javascript
// might be better in UNITY 
// javscript is good prototype

1. make some sort of battle system or things to do on quests
  - racing?
  - what am i fighting?
  - tie in with story

2. put on git and use it 

3. make it into an rpg like you always wanted
  - make car a drivable item or dressing pattern for player
  - make quests!
    - shit im gonna need an easy way to make quests
    - script system? xml?
  - what is the reason the player is doing this

4. make this thing a little more functional 
  - maybe take out update method
  - make player a set of values w/o functions
  - make it event driven

5. make a nice big map to drive around on
  - procedurally generated?
  - figure out how to draw part of the map
  - figure out how notch did those texturess

6. make a mother fucking story!!!!!
  - fun and exciting
  - must fit the art constraint
    - get that art guy involved
  - must grab you
    - short intro with mystery and intregue
    - one liner wtf
